@weskibet,"It sucks being in a situation where foreigners come and mistreat you in your home soil and you are in a position to literally do nothing, the pain is excruciating, I can never wish that on anyone but the world is a cycle, whatever you do to someone will in some way cycle back to you."
@sneakerhead6625,what disgusts me the most is that these people have ancestors who went through horrific genocide and were persecuted yet instead of using their own pain to prevent such things happening again it‚Äôs almost like they feel entitled to hurt others because they have been hurt.
@dianajames4717,As an American i am embarrassed over the treatment that israel and the United States treats the Palestinians You cannot oppress people and think that they will keep on taking it without standing up for themselves and fighting.
@bernardocisneros4402,I think all Americans should see this so that they're not fooled by these people.
@celesterosales8976,"‚ÄúA beautiful scene‚Äù    ?!?! How anyone could see the heartache of a big family losing their home to someone wanting to turn it into a parking lot for any reason, is sickening."
@jinshin3871,The smug look on their faces as they evict others. Literally can feel the anger of the Palestinians.

@fazfalouse9543,The nerve of a foreign people flying half way across the world to kick out indigenous people from their homes for another foreign people. This is crazy
@Human_Rights_23-zl1hv,Thank you for doing what you can to hold people accountable for inhumane acts.
@tore705,Kicking people out of their homes is so wrong. 
@MrHereWeGoYo,"Despicable.  I've never looked at Israel as the morally irreproachable people they're always held up to be but I have no personal issue with them.  The same goes for the Palestinians.  However, I'm glad that have old videos like this that are gaining more visibility for us on the outside to say ""Hey. Wait a minute.""  This is the kind of crap Palestinians have to put up with...for decades?"
@clownfish7776,Simply disgusting and unacceptable behavior.
@brandonb3262,"As an American, I‚Äôm almost over voting. Nothing gets better no matter who controls the government. We ignore Israel‚Äôs treatment of Palestinians while sending billions to Ukraine. We ignore sky rocketing housing cost. We ignore high inflation. We ignore student loan debt. If not for AJ, I wouldn‚Äôt even know about this. But Ukraine gets 24/7 coverage."
@Helpme9283,As a American Jew I and many others are ashamed to be in the same religion as these evil people I‚Äôm sorry to all Palestinians and Israelis that have been harmed by this
@rebekka9845,I feel sick over how palestinians have been treated by agressive israelis over so many years :( There is no excuse. Shame on those responsible! I pray and hope for peace in the region. Seing kids on both sides experience so much evil and violence and hatred makes me so sad.
@OfficiaFoxDeltaGames,"Thank you AJ+. It makes me sick as an American, that my country supports a supposed ‚Äúoppressed country‚Äù oppress its own people. This the very thing that the US stands against. I stand for justice. I stand with the people of Palestine"
@ThreaT650,"When you ask questions and they go silent and you know it is not silence being used to avoid incriminating oneself, then even they know what they are doing is absolutely awful."
@Airbutnotsoft97,"I don't get this at all. Even after watching the video. People are living in their family homes and then it's somehow sold out from under them? Then one day strangers show up to evict you? Where do these Palestinians go? Are they given a home to go too? Surely they aren't put on the street, children!? I feel it's complicated and difficult to unwind completely if you are not there to experience the reality.  But when I see this it's overwhelming and just cruel and mean and then to have Americans in there too. Good grief. This was heart breaking. I am not thinking there can be peace if people are being treated like this. I do not know anyone who would want to deal with this ruthless behavior and one of them has title RABBI!?"
@adilshah7450,"As an indian i can understand the pain a country and its people feel when foreigners come on your land to claim it and look down its native people, shame on such people. The prayer of an oppressed person is never rejected in the court of the lord. May the peace be upon the people of Palestine."
@olgakorunka7933,This is heartbreaking to watch and hard to understand how it's possible that this is happening.
@kamal-hg5jg,Thank you AJ for all these videos you upload for us. You go far and beyond to make sure we see and be aware of all the atrocities going on in this world.

@muradsulman1516,It‚Äôs very difficult to love your fellow human being after you see such hate and utter disregard for someone‚Äôs human rights. Shame on all of them.
@theodoretucker247,I am not Palestinian but my heart goes out to them ...they are no different than the Natives or Black Americans  here. They should he held accountable on a Global scale.  You  would figure that  due to the atrocities endured during the Holocaust they would have compassion and understanding to those who share the same ethnic experiences.
@s0fa274,"This is so hard to watch. I am Chinese American and this ideology that only one type of people are deemed worthy to enjoy rights reminds me of the most racist, backwater people in my country who think I don‚Äôt belong here. This is shameful and hate groups shouldn‚Äôt get tax exemption status. This supremacy complex is sickening. As a Christian and a human being with a pulse, this goes against my core. Hamas‚Äô reprehensible actions have just made the conflict far worse and possibly beyond repair."

@bilalabawi9064,The strength of the Palestinians is truely inspiring. I ask Allah to give me strength and resilience just like them. May their suffering and struggle not be for nothing. 
@Elshabbazz,"What can we expect from people who have stolen indigenous lands in the Americas? This is heartbreaking. This is a violation of human rights, no matter how you call it."
@cassandraclapp6667,"Disgusting and is there any wonder they hate us Americans? Rest assured we are not all like this. I am so sorry for your pain. I can only dream of owning a home I can not even imagine how you feel. 
All the Hispanics coming to America do not understand that we as citizens can not buy a home and live the life they think they are coming for. Times are extremely hard right now here too. Many prayers and love going your way. We are really all one color of skin or race doesn't matter."

@longjidalu3845,This is heart breaking. Imagine being thrown out of your ancestral home. This will only breed resentment and resort to extremism.
@robertdekane6153,"I don't know what is going on here, but in my heart this feels wrong. Here in the United States we have a law called eminent domain where the government can take your home your land and throw you out on the streets, but you must be fairly compensated."
@christiansgrignoli3351,"As an American with Italian, german, and irish heritage - I'm sorry for what Palestinians go through. I've read a few years ago about the power of AIPAC and the isreal lobby in america.. its financed by wealthy jews. Which is understandable that is there right.  But the fact that the US government and taxpayer funds this situation is insane. I'm sorry"

The usa welcomes all types of people, our diversity is our strength. The usa has 50% of the worlds jews living peacefully side by side everyone else.

It‚Äôs just an every day sickening reality and it just won‚Äôt stop. And what‚Äôs making me feel so sick is that so many people support this. Every day I see people supporting these actions and I ask myself do some people have no heart at all? No humanity. I feel so sick watching this and the pain in this woman‚Äôs eyes and voice and I wish I could do something to stop it but I can‚Äôt. Y‚Äôa Allah please save th√© people of Palestine.

Both cannot be true at the same time"

I have been in living in the ME for over 30 years, and I have worked alongside a lot of wonderfully kind and big hearted Arabs. I have also travelled to Palestine/Israel and traversed its stunningly beautiful landscape. I've seen both sides of the divide. It breaks my heart to watch the long suffering misery of the Palestinian people, the wanton dispossession and displacement of the rightful owners of the Palestinian land. I have tried to educate myself over these last 25 years in order to keep myself informed about this regional conflict. To me it is all very simple. It is the Powerful, bullying the Innocent law abiding, peaceful and defenseless people in this world. Funnily, I don't see all the big mouth protestors and celebrities out there offering their support. Each time they come out on to the street, they are present only to selfishly market themselves and their corporate sponsorship deals! And that is the whole truth unfortunately. Cheers."

W. but were deceived by them and eventually they ended up giving the Zionist movement the green light to go to Palestine."
@showandteller1471,Great report by AJ+ SHOWING REAL NEWS!  SHOWING OPPRESSION
@simsimsworld,This is pure evil.....Imagine if Black Africans did this to other ethnic groups who have decades and centuries long of lineage in a country and then kicked them off of their land and house without any alternative in place or reimbursement.

@GeorgeSweet,The real question imo is how much donation proceeds went to that overpriced dirt lot? It cost 100k which seems a very round number. If I had to guess they used 170k to obtain that lot. If you expose the waste in the org it might be easier to stop the org from procurring donations in the first place. Theres no way these people arent scooping significantly off the top to justify their place and time spent in the operation. This is basically a grift and its easier to convince the funders this is like burning a pile of money then to convince a lubed judge this is unlawful

@calba24,"This is so sad. I hope that a lot of Palestinians know that not all Americans support Israel in their wrongdoings against them. Not all of us Christians support Israel, but too many stand to defend them because they are in the Bible even though the majority of Jews hate Christianity. The Palestinian people are trying to make a decent life the rest of us, and not asking to be bothered as they want to live in peace, but some Israelis just want to continue harassing them for no reason at all. Taking someone‚Äôs home just because their ‚Äúancestors‚Äù had it before doesn‚Äôt give them the right to hurt Palestinians. It obvious, their ‚Äúancestors‚Äù left Israel for some reason so they cannot go back to reclaim. If someone was to do American Jews the way these disgraces of men were doing in the video, then they would be crying all day about anti-Semitism and others should defend them. Jewish-American men like those in the video is why a lot of people don‚Äôt like their group because they think they own everything, and that they can do everything under the sun without repercussions. Most are very arrogant. One day, their wrong doings and self-entitled pride are going to be their downfall‚Ä¶."
@glittermeat7266,"As the filmmaker alludes to at 10:00 minutes in, the properties at the center of this report are properties that were legally owned by Jewish families prior to the war of 1948. Following the war, Jordan annexed east Jerusalem and declared the area off-limits to all Jews, while allowing Palestinians to take over the homes that the Jews had been forced to leave behind. In 1967 the state of Israel gained control over east Jerusalem, and Jews were once again allowed to enter the area. Israeli courts have since ruled that Jews can reclaim the properties in east Jerusalem that Jews had been forced to vacate in 1948.  Many consider the reclaiming of these properties a way of righting past wrongs, while others find the evictions extremely unfair, as Israeli law does not allow Palestinians a similar right to reclaim property lost by Palestinians during the war of 1948."
@noway1880,"So in when the weight if Israeli Police, Military and city authorities are there to protect them its all smiles.

@soccergal30ful,"Unfortunately, this is a rental property. Even though this family has been living there for 70 years, they showed a rental agreement from 70 years ago to the police, a rental agreement not an ownership agreement which shows that they do not officially own the land. Speaking solely from a legal perspective, the Salem family never owned the land. The reporter even said, the original owners are not moving back in so legally speaking the Salem family does not own the house. As sad as this can be, this is not genocide or persecution. It's abiding by the law. Had the Salem family bought the land back in the 40s then ok, they have legal claim to it but in this case they do not and the new owners are justified in eviction."

@Nehmi,"The controversy lies in conflicting claims on who owns these homes.  So originally they were owned by North African Jews who were kicked out by the Jordanian occupation after 1948.  Then Palestinian families moved in.  After 1967, Israel occupied the West Bank.  Courts found that the Palestinian residents owed the original Jewish owners rent, which the families agreed.  But then in the 80s, the families stopped paying after pressure from the PLO.  So the courts are saying that after not paying rent for so long, the families have to be evicted."

@Gr8FriknApe,"‚ÄúIn 1947, the United Nations approved a plan to divide British Palestine into two mostly independent countries, one for Jews called Israel and one for Arabs called Palestine. Jerusalem, holy city for Jews and Muslims, was to be a special international zone.  On the eve of May 14, 1948 the Arabs launched an air attack on Tel Aviv, which the Israelis resisted. This action was followed by the invasion of the former Palestinian mandate by Arab armies from Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Egypt. ""  The Palestinians with the help of all those militaries were bent on killing all Israelis in that war.  They perpetrated 3 major attacks while trying to exterminate the Israelis. This attack is nothing new. The Palestinians continue to provoke as do the Israelis.   So, the question becomes, who continues to harass and kill the other?  Peace or no peace; If  you break into someone's home; start killing everyone in it, does that need a justification for defense and retaliation?  The Isreali's bear as much blame as the Palestinians in continuing this disgusting hate.  The Palestinians will now have to deal with the evil they have allowed into their communities.  May God Protect and Bless the innocent Palestinians with peace."

@sirfrozsomji3984,"The Jewish God is an Arabic pronoun: Ya = Oh! Howa = He Is. If you look in the transliterated Koran where you have Allah referred to as He, or He is, that is Howa in Arabic which you find littered everywhere in the Koran. There is also the ShasuYahu tribe mentioned by the Egyptians when these people came to settle in what is Jordan, formerly Edom or Seir: Judge:5, 4-5. ""YHWH when you went out of Seir. He was formerly worshipped by many desert nomadic Canaanite groups before being taken up by the Jews as their exclusive god. Nissim Amzallag claims Yahweh was originally a god of the forge and patron of metallurgists during the Bronze Age (c 3500 -1200 bc). Amazallag specifically cites the ancient copper mines of Timna Valley (in Southern Israel). Extra-biblical passages show Yahweh's similarities to gods of metallurgy in other cultures for support. Although the Bible and especially the Of Exodus show that Yahweh was exclusively the god of the Israelites, there are many passages that make clear that this deity was also worshipped by other people in Canaan, like Edomites, Kenites, Moabites, and Midianites. All worshipped Yahweh to one degree or another and there is evidence the Edomites who operated the mines at Timna converted an earlier Egyptian Temple of Hathor to the worship of Yahweh ( an imageless god). Although the biblical narratives depict Yahweh as the sole creator god, lord of the Universe, and the god of the Israelites, especially, initially he seems to have been Canaanite in origin and subordinate to the supreme god El. Canaanite inscriptions mention a lesser god Yahweh and even the biblical book of Deuteronomy stipulates that the ""Most High (Alayhi, Al Elyon ) gave to the nations their inheritance"" and that ""Yahweh's portion is his people Jacob and his allotted heritage"" (Det: 32: 8-9). Yahweh is also 62 nd attribute of Allah - Al Hayy - Al Hai in Hebrew - the Living - cognate to Arabic Haya - maybe Haya Asher Haya given to Moses. Yahweh: World History Encyclopaedia."

And We reinforced you with wealth and sons and made you more numerous in manpower. 7- [And said], ""If you do good, you do good for yourselves; and if you do evil, [you do it] to yourselves.""

I will restore them to THE LAND that I GAVE TO THEIR FATHERS, and THEY will POSSESS it.‚Äô‚Äù These are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah.‚Ä¶ Jeremiah 30.3 This is Israel's TITLE DEED and PROOF OF OWNERSHIP. You have the legal right to take back what the thief has stolen from you, even if the thief claims it belongs to them. Stolen goods or occupied property does not belong to anyone else other than the original owner who has proof of purchase or the title deed. Allah said so be it. Whoever denies that Allah has spoken these words denies Allah's authority and rule over the nations. But whoever honors the words of Allah will be blessed by Israel. Indeed without a word, Jesus Christ at his second coming will split the Olive mountain into two and everyone will know that the land belongs to the Jewish people."

@farozara5194,"‚ÄúBehold the disturbances which, for many a long year, have afflicted the earth, and the perturbation that hath seized its peoples. It hath either been ravaged by war, or tormented by sudden and unforeseen calamities. Though the world is encompassed with misery and distress, yet no man hath paused to reflect what the cause or source of that may be. Whenever the True Counselor uttered a word in admonishment, lo, they all denounced Him as a mover of mischief and rejected His claim. How bewildering, how confusing is such behavior! No two men can be found who may be said to be outwardly and inwardly united. The evidences of discord and malice are apparent everywhere, though all were made for harmony and union. The Great Being saith: O well-beloved ones! The tabernacle of unity hath been raised; regard ye not one another as strangers. Ye are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch. We cherish the hope that the light of justice may shine upon the world and sanctify it from tyranny. If the rulers and kings of the earth, the symbols of the power of God, exalted be His glory, arise and resolve to dedicate themselves to whatever will promote the highest interests of the whole of humanity, the reign of justice will assuredly be established amongst the children of men, and the effulgence of its light will envelop the whole earth. The Great Being saith: The structure of world stability and order hath been reared upon, and will continue to be sustained by, the twin pillars of reward and punishment.... In another passage He hath written: Take heed, O concourse of the rulers of the world! There is no force on earth that can equal in its conquering power the force of justice and wisdom.... Blessed is the king who marcheth with the ensign of wisdom unfurled before him, and the battalions of justice massed in his rear. He verily is the ornament that adorneth the brow of peace and the countenance of security. There can be no doubt whatever that if the day star of justice, which the clouds of tyranny have obscured, were to shed its light upon men, the face of the earth would be completely transformed.‚Äù"

@es1653,"There are illegal squatters from 1948 or before, but the Jews owned the land long before 1948 and they have the legal deed that states when they bought the land (many deeds are from early 1900's or earlier).  Those that never had the deed to the place they are living are squatters, fraudsters; it doesn't  matter if they were born there, if their grandfather doesn't have the deed to the land they squat on then the rightful owners are the people with the legal deed with their name on it. I have never heard such ""tall tales"" and lies as here, these squatters trying to convince others the land is theirs although they have no documentation and deed to prove it!"

@judgedayan9934,"Listen carefully, this report and hatchet job is not telling you the truth. The house in the Sheikh Jara neighborhood (known by the Jews who lived there before 1948 as the Shimon Hatzadik neighborhood) is owned by Jews who were thrown out by the Jordanians in 1948. The family of the owners maintained their title deeds and valid proof of ownership and the case was tied up in Israeli courts for years. They finally proved ownership beyond a shadow of a doubt and the court, I might add, reluctantly, had to order eviction of the Arab squatters. therefore these American Jews had every right to put up a fence around the property."

@klchai7884,"In 250 years of existence as a nation, the US has fought against 29 sovereign countries. (In Fact, since 1785, US have been involved, for 219 years, in some kind of war. And this wars, against all varieties of sovereign nations. From going against the Sultan of Morocco, to invading the tiny island of Grenada. Well, this means that in its entire history, it has only had 17 years of peace, and even fewer, cuz here the almost 5 years (1861-1865), of its Civil War of Secession are not counted (Union/Confederates), since this war was not with another country, but against US. And the wars against the Native Nations of America are not counted too, for the same reason). Anyway: US fought against 29 countries. It has ""Grown"" 711 times the size of its territory from the original 13 colonies. It has provoked with total impunity, Genocides, inside and outside its own borders, and assassinations of Gov‚Äôt. Leaders, Coups d'√âtat and Economic Blockades in 6 UN member nations. (Between 1947 and 1989, the US tried to change other nations gov‚Äôts. 73 times. It includes 66 covert Ops. And 7 overt ones. In Civil Wars: The US has taken advantage of and intervened without justification in the following Civil Wars: In Cuba (1898 and 1960). In Haiti (1813 and then 1915-1934). In Colombia (1899-1902 and 1948). In Mexico (1847 and 1914 and again in 1916). In Russia (1918). In the ""Republic Banana Wars"" of Central America (1912-1934). In Venezuela (1945 and again in 1948). In China (1857, and 1900, and again in 1945-1946-1949). In Korea (1950-1953). In Viet Nam (1959-1975). In Panama (1964 and again 1989). In Central Africa (1969-1974 and 1982-1988). In Nicaragua (1937 and 1985). In Bosnia (1995). In the Philippines (1898 and 1900)... In Kosovo, Libya, Lebanon, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Afghanistan, etc.). And more: US has almost 800 Military Bases scattered around the world; 93 of which are against China. On the other hand, China and N. Korea (The ""Axis of Evil""), in 1,000 years of history have NEVER invaded anyone. These nations have fought their Civil Wars, defended themselves against foreign invasions, and secured their immediate borders, but they have never been meddling or aggressor countries. Do you know how many Military Bases China or N. Korea have outside their territory? None. Zero. Any. NADA! They do not have a single Base. These are verifiable facts. Neither China nor Korea will invade the world; US does... that's DONE, as US does in the Middle East. Iran also does not have a SINGLE MILITARY BASE outside its national territory, and it is surrounded by 16 US Bases, and it is US who call the Iranians Terrorists. Well, very good. You already know. Now, compare the Greatness of the US with the Greatness of China. The ""Greatness"" of the US is built on the foundations of Piracy, Slavery, Genocide, the Assassination of opponents, Opium Traffic, or Cocaine in its case, and is under the foundations of the weakness of other sovereign nations.

The irony is that the Palestinians also descend from the Biblical Jews and Canaanites, after the process of Islamization and Arabization, many pre-Islamic Arab kingdoms were Jews like Himyar in present-day Yemen, and after all, much of the mythical territory belonging to Israel was stolen from the Canaanites"

Is there a land code of some sort  that says who's land belong to Israel and what land belongs to Palestinians? If they have legal proof by the laws and the agreement of land between Palistenian and Jerusalem and the United Nation then evicting which is sad is legally binding and they would have  the right to evict. Now of course if the mind of Palestinians that think all  of Israel is there's when it was lost in a war, and from an Israel standpoint, Israel has always been there land from Biblical historical proofs. What I'm seeing is a video sided to this Palestinians couple to make the Jerusalem land getter as bad people. When everything there doing is by legal  means. So is it truly wrong what there doing if it is done legally by the laws of the land?"

By the way: you like numbers, statistics and facts? 900,000 Jews were displaced by their home countries (the Arab countries). Read about the Jewish Expulsion from the Muslim World."

@hasoon1657,"I believe Jews shouldn‚Äôt think that they are chosen, even if there religion says that, it proves there religion is false because god blesses the seed of righteous and not a people who contain both righteous and evil people. Even there religion is says that, look at genesis 9:1. And then after that, god ONLY chooses the Jewish people, there are some alteration in the Torah i can see that. There god blessed both Ishmael and Isaac, that means they are not chosen, the righteous are who are chosen. God blesses all at first like Noah, Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac and then god starts talking about the Jews only, that‚Äôs in the Torah, in the Quran I can see that god is abandoning the children of Israel and making a covenant with Muslims. That‚Äôs why god still exiles the Jews."
